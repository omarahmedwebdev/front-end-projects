# 🖥️ Front-End Practice Projects

This repository contains **personal front-end practice projects** I created during prep school to learn and experiment with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap**, and libraries like **WOW.js**.  
Each folder represents a separate project and was built as a **learning exercise using sample content**.

## ⚙️ Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Libraries: WOW.js, Animate.css, others for UI effects

## 🚀 Projects Included
- `arsha-coders-team/` – A website for an imaginary coding company called Arsha.
- `framecoders/` – A modern website with neat design for imaginary coding company called FrameCoders.

*(Each project is self-contained in its own folder with its folders and files.)*
